Types of Data Science Questions:
     - Descriptive analysis: goal of descriptive analysis is to describe or summarize a set of data. 
     - Exploratory analysis:The goal of exploratory analysis is to examine or explore the data and find relationships that weren’t previously known
     - Inferential analysis: The goal of inferential analyses is to use a relatively small sample of data to infer or say something about the population at large
     - Predictive analysis: The goal of predictive analysis is to use current data to make predictions about future data
     - Causal analysis: The caveat to a lot of the analyses we’ve looked at so far is that we can only see correlations and can’t get at the cause of the relationships we observe
     - Mechanistic analysis: Mechanistic analyses are not nearly as commonly used as the previous analyses - the goal of mechanistic analysis is to understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables
	 
Data Frame
	They are represented as a special type of list where every element of the list has to have the
	same length
	Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list
	is the number of rows
	Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (just like lists);
	matrices must have every element be the same class
	Data frames also have a special attribute called row.names
	Data frames are usually created by calling read.table() or read.csv()
	Can be converted to a matrix by calling data.matrix()

Reading Data
There are a few principal functions reading data into R.
	read.table, read.csv, for reading tabular data
	readLines, for reading lines of a text file
	source, for reading in R code files (inverse of dump)
	dget, for reading in R code files (inverse of dput)
	load, for reading in saved workspaces
	unserialize, for reading single R objects in binary form
Writing Data 
	write.table
	writeLines
	dump
	dput
	save
	serialize
Read file with read.table:
	file, the name of a file, or a connection
	header, logical indicating if the file has a header line
	sep, a string indicating how the columns are separated
	colClasses, a character vector indicating the class of each column in the dataset
	nrows, the number of rows in the dataset
	comment.char, a character string indicating the comment character
	skip, the number of lines to skip from the beginning
	stringsAsFactors, should character variables be coded as factors?
