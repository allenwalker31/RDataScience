str function
	is that it's suppose to compactly display the internal structure of an R object, so str, str, you can think of as being, meaning structure.
simulation random number

	Functions for probability distributions in R
		rnorm: generate random Normal variates with a given mean and standard deviation
		dnorm: evaluate the Normal probability density (with a given mean/SD) at a point (or vector of points)
		pnorm: evaluate the cumulative distribution function for a Normal distribution
		rpois: generate random Poisson variates with a given rate
	
	distribution funtion
		d for density
		r for random number generation
		p for cumulative distribution
		q for quantile function
		
		If phi is the cumulative distribution function for a standard Normal distribution, then pnorm(q) = phi(q) and qnorm(p) = phi ^ -1(p).
	Setting the random number seed with set.seed ensures reproducibility

Simulation a linear model

sample function draws randomly from a specified set of (scalar) objects allowing yo to sample from arbitrary distribution.

profiler
	Rprof() start profiler
	summaryRprof() to summary the output
	dont use system.time() and Rprof() together
